    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

    <p>
      I am writing to express my interest in the Fullstack Developer position at Nextgen. 
      I recently completed projects using Java, Spring Boot, and web technologies, and I am eager to bring my skills to your team.
    </p>

    <p>
      During my recent project work I developed full-stack features such as user authentication,
      file uploads, and CRUD operations. I am comfortable working with Java, Spring Boot, MySQL,
      basic frontend markup, and integrating third-party services. I am a quick learner and enjoy solving problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe my technical background and enthusiasm for building dependable software make me a good fit for this role.
      I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.
    </p>

    <p>Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing this opportunity with you.</p>
